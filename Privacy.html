    <p> 
      A lot of people take the stance of <em>“I don’t do anything wrong, therefore I have nothing to hide.”</em> however that is largely <em> misinterpreted </em>. You have everything to hide. So many apps, websites and services we use online today host a trove of data about their users, they’re a goldmine for a cybercriminal.

      <li><span class = "head"> Limit what your share on social media </span> - Providing too much information on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram could make it easier for cybercriminals to obtain identifying information, which could allow them to steal your identity or to access your financial information </li>
      <br></br>
      <li> <span class = "head"> Search Engine </span> - If you’re like many web surfers, you rely heavily on Google as your search engine. But you don’t have to. Privacy is one reason people prefer to use anonymous search engines. This type of search engine doesn’t collect or share your search history or clicks. Anonymous search engines can also block ad trackers on the websites you visit.</li>
      <br></br>
      <li> <span class = "head" > Watch what you click </span> - One of the ways in which hackers compromise your online privacy is through phishing attempts. In phishing, scammers try to trick you into providing valuable financial or personal information. They’ll often do this by sending fake emails that appear to be from banks, credit card providers, or other financial institutions. </li>
